# Bucket
This is Bucket, this is a community portal built on top of [SandCastle](http://www.github.com/fuzzyfox/SandCastle).

## Install
Installation is two-phased. First you need to grab a copy of bucket, and put it into the root dir for your site.
	
	git clone git://github.com/fuzzyfox/Bucket.git ./
	
Next you will need to navigate to `/install` via your web browser. (e.g. http://www.yourbucketinstall.com/install/) and follow the instructions there.

Finally... finish setting up Bucket by logging into the admin interface `/admin` using the following credentials (which we recommend you remove ASAP).

	Email:		j.doe@example.com
	Password:	password
	
**Note** you should probably create an account for yourself first before removing Mr John Doe :P
